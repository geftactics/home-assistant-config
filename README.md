# Home Assistant Config
I'm currently running [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) for my home automation.

Components include:
* Nest Protect (Smoke and Carbon monoxide detectors)
* TP-Link Smart Plugs
* Sonoff ESP8266 switches
* Amazon FireTV
* Central heating (via Raspberry Pi GPIO controlled relay board)
* Met Office (Temperature and weather)
* Presence Detection (Home Assistant iOS app)
* Fritz Router (Internet usage graphs)
* Waze/Google-Maps (For high commute time warnings)
* Custom sensors (General or recyclying waste collection)
* Ikea Tradfri gateway

Looks a bit like this:
