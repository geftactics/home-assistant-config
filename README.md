# Home Assistant Config
I'm currently running [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) for my home automation.

Components include:
* Nest Protect (Smoke and Carbon monoxide detectors)
* TP-Link Smart Plugs
* Sonoff ESP8266 switches
* Central heating (via Raspberry Pi GPIO controlled relay board)
* Met Office (Temperature and weather)
* Presence Detection (Home Assistant iOS app)

Looks a bit like this:
